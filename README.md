# Welcome! 

This is a sample blog page, where you can add multiple post with images and text, can edit them and of course search in all post info

This CRUD is developed with React (RCA), SASS, Bootstrap in the Front-End, and Node.JS, Express, Mongoose and Mongo Atlas in the Back-End in a API Rest mode

## You can run it locally in two simple steps

### 1- Download the repo and run npm install
### 2- Run npm run start

*The API Rest is a little slow to run the first time, because is a free instance in render.com

**The DB may be blocked by your ip, it need to white listed before the connection
